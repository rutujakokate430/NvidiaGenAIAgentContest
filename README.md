Human Resource Portal- HR GPT üóíÔ∏è
The Human Resource Portal is a comprehensive tool designed for HR executives to streamline candidate screening, perform background verification, identify better fitting job roles, and determine average salary ranges. This project leverages NVIDIA's NIM endpoints for inference and NeMo‚Ñ¢ Guardrails to ensure accurate and compliant responses from language models.

Features
Candidate Screening: Utilizes RAG to extract tokens from resumes and job descriptions, creating embeddings for matching skills.

Background Verification: A LangChain agent performs web searches to verify candidate backgrounds, calculating estimated ages based on available data.

Better Fitting Job Roles: LangChain agents search for job openings that closely match candidates' skills from their resumes.

Average Salary Range: LangChain agents search for and provide the average salary range for specific job roles based on market standards.
